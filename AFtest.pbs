# and have no effect.

# If you launched the job in a directory prepared for the job to run within,
# you'll want to cd to that directory
# [uncomment the following line to enable this]
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

# Alternatively, the job script can create its own job-ID-unique directory
# to run within.  In that case you'll need to create and populate that
# directory with executables and perhaps inputs
# [uncomment and customize the following lines to enable this behavior]
# mkdir -p /scratch/sciteam/$USER/$PBS_JOBID
# cd /scratch/sciteam/$USER/$PBS_JOBID
