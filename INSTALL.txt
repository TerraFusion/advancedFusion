Below are the steps for building AFtool from the command line in a terminal with ‘$’ representing the prompt. 

1. How to build AFtool on Blue Waters

1)	Prepare GNU build environment
	$ module   swap  PrgEnv-cray   PrgEnv-gnu
2)	Enable HDF5 to be used
	$ module   load  cray-hdf5/1.8.16
	Note: the tool was developed based on HDF5 version 1.8.16, 
              the latest HDF5 1.8 version at Blue Waters as this document was written. 
              We also tested the tool with HDF5 1.10.2, the latest HDF5 1.10 version at Blue Waters.
3)	$ cd advancedFusion/src
4)	$ export CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic
	$ make
Or
	$ CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE=dynamic   make

5)	Executable AFtool is generated under the directory advancedFusion.

2. How to build AFtool on Linux
The gdal ,openmp, and hdf5 libraries are required to build AF tool on Linux.

1)	$ cd advancedFusion/src
2)	Edit Makefile, Replace the gdal,openmp and hdf5 path with the corresponding path at your system
3)	$make 	
4)	Executable AFtool is generated under the directory advancedFusion.


3. How to build AFtool on Mac(Not thoroughly tested)
The gdal2, libomp and hdf5 libraries are required to build AF tool on Mac.
Homebrew package manager can be used to install these libraries on the Mac.  

1)	$ cd  advancedFusion/src/
2)	$ cp Makefile Makefile.ori
3)	$ cp Makefile.mac  Makefile
4)	May need to edit Makefile.mac with your own gdal2,libomp and hdf5 path.
5)	$make 	
6)	Executable AFtool is generated under the directory advancedFusion.
